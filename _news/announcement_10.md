The birdsong recognition algorithm AvesEcho, which I developed at Naturalis, was added to Xeno-canto, the world's biggest animal sound repository. The ML model is also the first one to be hosted on the forum. Read more [here](https://xeno-canto.org/article/299). The inference model is available in [this GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/arise-biodiversity/DSI/algorithms/avesecho-v1).
