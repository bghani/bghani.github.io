Starting work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in AI & Biodiversity at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands beginning Jan 2023. I will be working closely with [Dan Stowell](https://www.naturalis.nl/en/science/researchers/dan-stowell) to develop audio recognition algorithms to identify a variety of European taxa.
