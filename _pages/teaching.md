- I'm currently working toward developing audio recognition algorithms to identify a variety of European taxa including birds, bats, marine mammals, pollinating insects, and grasshoppers. This work is conducted as part of the [HorizonEU](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en) projects [MAMBO](https://mambo-project.eu), [GUARDEN](https://guarden.org) and [TETTRIs](https://www.ecsa.ngo/cases/tettris/).

## mentorship
- 2022 - Co-supervised Drew Priebe (Tilburg University) on his BSc thesis titled: “Efficient speech detection in environmental audio using acoustic recognition and model distillation”

- 2022 - Co-supervised six students from [HvA Amsterdam](https://www.hva.nl) on their project on automated audio classification titled: [“Sing A Song”](https://vriesn23.dev.hihva.nl/aai-naturalis-1/) through [ARISE](https://www.arise-biodiversity.nl).
