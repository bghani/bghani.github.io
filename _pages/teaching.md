- I'm currently working toward developing audio recognition algorithms to identify a variety of European taxa including birds, bats, marine mammals, pollinating insects, and grasshoppers. This work is conducted as part of the [HorizonEU](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en) projects [MAMBO](https://mambo-project.eu), [GUARDEN](https://guarden.org) and [TETTRIs](https://www.ecsa.ngo/cases/tettris/).

- Collaborated with [Stefan Kahl](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/stefan-kahl/) and [Holger Klinck](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/holger-klinck/) from [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) and [Tom Denton](https://inventingsituations.net) from Google Brain on a project to investigate the utility of feature embeddings from multiple large scale audio-based deep learning classifiers for varied fine and course-grained bioacoustics classification tasks.
