## Your Blog Post Content

Welcome to my blog! This is where I share articles about mathematics.

### Example Math Equation

Here is an example of an inline equation: \( E = mc^2 \).

And hereâ€™s a block equation:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx

You can start adding your articles here. Each new post will be its own file in the `_posts` directory.

```markdown
{% for post in site.posts %}
* [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }})
{% endfor %}
