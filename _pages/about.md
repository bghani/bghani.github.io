Biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate: the WWF Living Planet Index reports [~69% decline](https://www.wwf.eu/?7780966/WWF-Living-Planet-Report-Devastating-69-drop-in-wildlife-populations-since-1970) in monitored vertebrate populations since 1970, and [~1 million species](https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment) are threatened with extinction (IPBES). My work is motivated by the need to build tools that provide reliable estimates of ecosystem health. I focus on sound because it scales: it captures soniferous life continuously, non-invasively, and across vast areas. My research combines machine learning with ecology and bioacoustics to make sound a core tool for biodiversity monitoring.

I trained as a computer scientist and obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Göttingen, where I ventured into bioacoustics. Since then I have specialized in computational bioacoustics, developing open-source models such as [AvesEcho](https://gitlab.com/arise-biodiversity/DSI/algorithms/avesecho-v1). The model was [integrated into Xeno-canto](https://www.naturetoday.com/intl/en/nature-reports/message/?msg=33042), the world’s biggest bird sound forum. To me, that was an important moment - it was no longer just an academic model, but something that birders and conservationists could actually use. More recently, I co-launched [InsectSet459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15074), an insect sound deep learning benchmark, to broaden acoustic monitoring beyond birds. My broader vision is to build computational tools that help us better understand and protect the living world.


<!-- My research focuses on developing robust machine learning methods for biodiversity monitoring, with a particular emphasis on sound-based approaches. I aim at creating scalable, field-deployable solutions for detecting and classifying animal vocalizations, enabling real-time and high-throughput ecological assessments. My broader vision is to contribute to the development of multimodal and multi-scale frameworks that integrate diverse data sources for a more holistic understanding of ecosystems. I obtained a master’s and a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Göttingen in Germany, where I ventured into bioacoustics, focusing on bird species classification, the impact of species selection on classification outcomes, and algorithmic analysis of intra-species song variations. 

My current work aims to bridge AI and ecological conservation by advancing computational tools that can be effectively applied in real-world biodiversity monitoring. This has the potential to greatly benefit wildlife experts, conservation biologists and ecologists by providing automated tools for long-term environmental monitoring. The central focus of my current work lies in processing extensive datasets of environmental sounds, enabling the extraction of valuable insights into the hidden world of animal communication. In nature, while many animals are visually elusive, their vocalizations offer a wealth of information about their habitats, seasonal changes, and interactions. My goal is to create automated processes that accelerate and streamline the analysis, ultimately contributing to the protection and conservation of our planet's diverse species and ecosystems.
