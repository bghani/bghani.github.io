“We call it a grain of sand,  
but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.  
It does just fine, without a name,  
whether general, particular,  
permanent, passing,  
incorrect, or apt.  

Our glance, our touch means nothing to it.  
It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched.  
And that it fell on the windowsill  
is only our experience, not its.  
For it, it is not different from falling on anything else  
with no assurance that it has finished falling  
or that it is falling still.  

The window has a wonderful view of a lake,  
but the view doesn’t view itself.  
It exists in this world  
colorless, shapeless,  
soundless, odorless, and painless.  

The lake’s floor exists floorlessly,  
and its shore exists shorelessly.  
The water feels itself neither wet nor dry  
and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural.  
They splash deaf to their own noise  
on pebbles neither large nor small.  

And all this beheath a sky by nature skyless  
in which the sun sets without setting at all  
and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud.  
The wind ruffles it, its only reason being  
that it blows.  

A second passes.  
A second second.  
A third.  
But they’re three seconds only for us.  

Time has passed like courier with urgent news.  
But that’s just our simile.  
The character is inverted, his hasts is make believe,  
his news inhuman.”  

― Wisława Szymborska, View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems
