Gratitude is an acknowledgment of our insignificance, of our utter lack of control, of the ever looming uncertainty - against which we throw our arms in the air and guard whatever little comes our way with a visceral appreciation. It is a deeply felt understanding we arrive at, that nothing is promised, and everything can be taken away in the blink of an eye. It is the lens through which we reconcile the unpredictability of life. It is an antidote to the arrogance of entitlement. Gratitude is not merely a feeling but an act of grounding ourselves: cherishing the little things that give us joy, and letting go of what we cannot have with grace instead of bitterness.
