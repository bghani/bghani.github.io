In this spread out instance of a lifetime, we carve out little chunks of illusions to get a grasp on our lives: We label these neatly as years, months, weeks, days, and so on; granting us some mastery over the fleeting nature of sight and memory, a semblance of control. Yet, in our quest for predictability, we are perpetually confronted with life’s inherent uncertainty. No matter how much we try, we cannot bypass it. Often, the order of these temporal illusions follows a linearity, but there are moments when a day can stretch longer than a month, and a second can hold a lifetime’s worth of meaning. There is no escape from this dichotomy, and we are forever condemned to its beauty and its turmoil.

However, within this chaos lies hope, ensconced in evanescent moments that twinkle like lover’s eyes in the darkest hours, guiding us through another year. As we stand on the brink of the new and reminisce the old, let’s embrace the unpredictable journey with all the courage we can muster, find solace in the little joys, and cherish the hopeful whispers of moments yet to unfold.

Here’s wishing you all a very Happy New Year!
