In the equation of fulfillment, pain is an essential variable. As humans, we constantly create and refine stories about our lives. Suffering, while painful and unwelcome, plays a crucial role in shaping and evolving these narratives. It is through facing and overcoming challenges we grow, find deeper meaning, and ultimately achieve a sense of fulfillment.

"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." -- Serenity Prayer
